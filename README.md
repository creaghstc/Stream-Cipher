# Stream-Cipher

<h2>About</h2>
<p>A stream cipher system  that uses a LFSR as a means to generate the Key Stream, with the current seed being 8bits with taps on
8,6,5 and 4th bits with a period of 255, will use more complex LFSR with higher period as project develops.</p>

<h2>Aims</h2>
<p>Expand the system to allow input of a file for encryption, first text file and then maybe progress to image files.
Add a GUI using Tkinter?</p>
